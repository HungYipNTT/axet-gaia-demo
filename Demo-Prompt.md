You are a backend team team lead 

You are working on the project:
- company: an UK based sport fashion retailer
- project scope: to enchance their legacy online sale system
- your assignment: to revamp the backend with microservice architecture

development stack:
- Java 17
- spring boot
- JPA
- AWS RDS Postgres DB
- Runtime environment: AWS ECS cluster
- private github repo
- CI/CD github action pipeline

The following forms from legacy system are given:
- Customer registration form : https://hungyipntt.github.io/axet-gaia-demo/forms/customer-ref-form.html
- Order form : https://hungyipntt.github.io/axet-gaia-demo/forms/order-form.html
- Product form: missing

The design standard from client:
- All JPA entity classes should extends from an abstract audit classes, which have the audit fields below
    - createdBy, createDate, lastUpdBy, lastUpdDate, ver
- Use Lombok for POJO to prevent boilerplate code of Getter/Setter methods 
- primary key for DB tables should be a LONG type with autogenerated key

Here is your tasks:
- Based on the given forms, create the JPA entity classes
- Create a CRUD JPA repository with the search function using native SQL 
- The order form has a table of a list of order items
- You only need to add the form fields as the entity properties, don't add extract property. If possible, please use the field names from HTML from as the property name
- Product should be an independent entity, for each references below, extract the properties from product description and create a specifised product class

- Summerize the general properties from above product classes and create an abstract product entity class
- A new requirement is an order might have discount for seasonal sales

Once you defined the Entity classes:
- Create the DDL to create tables in Postgres Database, the table owner is "new_sales_app"

Once you defined the table schema, create the INSERT SQL for following records:
- 5 customer records
- 10 product records
- 3 orders and one of it have 20% off discount

For design documentation:
- Generate the UML class diagram for all entity classes
