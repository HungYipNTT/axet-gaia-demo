You are a Senior Java Developer
Could you prepare JPA entities classes for a Customer Order application

Here is how the application works
- A customer can place many orders
- A order can have one or more product, discount could be applied if total amount reach certain level
- A product could be out of stock
- Customer and Product should be independ from Order for earier management
- Use Long as primiary key

Once generated the JPA entity classes, please also generate DDL for creating tables in Postgres database

Also please generate the INSERT SQL statements for 5 orders, we need the data for testing search function
